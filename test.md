# Heading

a paragraph

\[
with a math equation
\]

another paragraph

## Second heading

- line with **bold** text, _italic_ text, ~~striked~~ text, ..underlines.., ||highlights||, and `code`.

  ```lang
      code block //TODO: Remove indentation
      line
      line
      line
  ```

  this is a second line

  - a nested line with $maths$
    with another line in the same paragraph

    and a new paragraph

- and a last item with a long and useless text just to see if nbsp is working~:

this is the end
